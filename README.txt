# Code

You may insert your code into this directory.

What did you make? Provide samples of code, showing what you learned. These samples can be demos. They donâ€™t need to be polished; they just need to demonstrate what you experimented with.

**The code that goes in this directory will be the raw code. Code that you can view in the editor.**

**Do not submit the build code here.**

The build code will be uploaded to the server.

The code folder will contain all code (could be typescript, scss, html, css, javascript, configuration files, php, and any other code you wrote for the exploration).

The more code the better.

**The code will not be published on the discussion board**

**Note:** If you followed a tutorial online, make sure you reference the tutorial, and make sure you go above and beyond the tutorial. If you don't reference the tutorial, you will receive a zero. If you simply copy the tutorial without adding your own content, styles, and code into the project you will receive a zero.
